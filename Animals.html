  <h2>Effect on Animals</h2>
  <p>"Over 1 million seabirds and 100,000 sea mammals are killed by pollution every year.
       Immediately after the Exxon Valdez oil spill,more than 100,000 sea birds died, along with more than 1,000 sea otters. 144 bald eagles also died as a result of the spill.
	   Air pollutants called chloroflurocarbons, or CFC's for short are thinning the Ozone layer, exposing animals, plants and other organisms to the suns ultra violet radiation.\
	   "
	   <p> Animals can be effected by things such as small as a piece of gum. When we spit out our gum on the street it is a hazard for tiny birds.
	   If birds step into the gum it could get stuck in their feathers making it hard to move.
	   <p> When our trash is left in the ocean it becomes posible food for the sea animals. 100 million sea animals are killed each year from consuming plastic waste. 
	   Once an animal consumes plastic it is in their digestive system making it hard for them to live.
