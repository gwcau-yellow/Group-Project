  <h2>Welcome</h2>
  <p>This website was put together by Sophia Cahanding, Gwen Goman, Kirklyn Branch, Destiny Johnson, and Ariana Thitilerdwong. These
  girls are part of a Girls Who Code program and were tasked with making some kind of code project (such as a game
  or website) that helps make a difference in their community. The group got to pick the topic of their project. They chose to make 
  a website raising awareness about pollution</p>
  <h2>Our Inspiration</h2>
