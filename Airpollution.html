  <h2>Air Pollution</h2>
  
  <h5>Burning of Fossil Fuels</h5>
  <p>Transportation exhaust fumes cause large amounts of air pollution. </p>
  <h5>Agricultural Activities</h5>
    <p>Fumes from nitrogen-rich fertilizers and animal waste combine in the air with combustion emissions to form solid particles in the air.Agricultural air pollution comes mainly in form of ammonia, which enters the air as a gas from heavily fertilized fields and livestock waste.	</p> 
       
  <h5>How Does Air Pollution Affect Animals</h5>
  <p>All animals, despite their size, can be affected by pollution. Animals depend on oxygen that comes from the air, and when air is contaminated, harmful gases and particulates are inhaled.
  The pollution that animals inhale can accumulate in their tissues over time, causing damage to their organs.</p>
